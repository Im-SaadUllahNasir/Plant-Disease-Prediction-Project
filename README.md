# Plant Disease Prediction

## Overview
The Plant Disease Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict and identify diseases in plants based on images of their leaves. The model helps in early detection, which can assist farmers and gardeners in taking timely action to protect plants and crops.

## Features
- **Disease Detection**: Predicts plant diseases from leaf images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The model can be integrated into web or mobile applications for real-time predictions.
- **Fast Response Time**: Provides predictions quickly to help in prompt decision-making.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The main programming language for data processing and model development.
- **TensorFlow**: Used for building and training deep learning models.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow.
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing and handling.
- **Flask/Django**: To create a web service for the model (if applicable).
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and model evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of labeled images of plant leaves, categorized based on various diseases. It is available from several open repositories, including [Kaggle Plant Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com).

## How to Use
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/plant-disease-prediction.git
   cd plant-disease-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Model Performance
The model achieves an accuracy of **XX%** on the validation dataset. You can further optimize the model using techniques like data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, or adding more data.
